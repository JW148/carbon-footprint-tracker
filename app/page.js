            In an effort to mitigate our Carbon Footprint, first it is important
            to understand what our current situation is. This page will provide
            a way of logging membersâ€™ travel mileage to Club runs and events,
            and keep a running tally. Once we have an idea of monthly/yearly
            travel we can take steps to reduce our carbon footprint. We
            encourage members to car-share where possible to reduce our impact
            on the climate.
